## `ToDo-ti-fruity`
A fun and fruity ToDo app!  With this app you can: 

* Login
* View your existing todos
* Create new todos
* Mark your todos as completed
* Delete your todos

Once you have completed all of your todos you can logout. 

## `Tech Stack`

Built with React using React Hooks for state management, Redux and Redux Thunk for asynchronous middleware management, with Jest and Enzyme for TDD. 

## `Usage`
To run locally, clone this repository. After cd'ing into the appropriate directory, run:

```yarn``` to install necessary dependencies and ```yarn start``` to run the app in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Once you login, you can start tracking all of your todos!

## `Improvements`

Given more time I would like to complete the following:

* Reverse the order of todos
* Implement functional TDD using Jest and Enzyme
* More client-side validation
* Restructure state data structure when returned from reducer
* Clean up Redux errors in console
* Persist DELETE and PUT 
* Refactor scss
